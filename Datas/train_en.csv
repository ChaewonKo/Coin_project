SHIB will initially be tradeable against the USD and Euro pairs however Kraken Futures and Margin Trading for SHIB won’t be available at launch.Australian managing director at Kraken Jonathon Miller told Cointelegraph that the crypto marketplace supports projects with a clear demand for trading including SHIB. At the time of publishing SHIB is the 12th-largest cryptocurrency with a market capitalization of $25.81 billion. SHIB has surged over 20% in the last 24 hours on the listing news.Miller added: “I wouldn't describe Kraken as being the place where every single coin is listed that's not been what we have been known for.”Kraken is one of the least conservative exchanges with 93 assets on the exchange in total. Meanwhile Coinbase supports 51 assets and Robinhood only supports seven. Other exchanges have been hesitant to list the Dogecoin-inspired altcoin over regulatory concerns despite increasing pressure from their users. On Nov. 26 SHIB surpassed 1 million holders despite trading 50% below its all-time high.On Nov. 10 Robinhood chief operating officer Christine Brown said that the platform’s “strategy is different than a lot of the other players out there who are racing to list as many assets as possible right now.” The Change.org petition requesting that Robinhood lists the Shiba Inu Coin has amassed over half a million signatures. Miller added: “There are certain services that we have that don't really fit the regulatory mold. So there's this gray area that the whole industry exists in and that's not specific to us.”“That's just the nature of the fact that we're dealing with an innovative technology that really doesn't have doesn't necessarily fit the criteria that existing regulators perceive as possible.”Related: Reserve Bank warns Aussies over punting on ‘fad driven’ cryptocurrenciesDescribing the current regulatory climate for digital asset exchanges Robinhood's chief legal officer Dan Gallagher said at the Georgetown University Financial Markets Quality Conference on Nov. 19 that ""It's a very tense situation and it does call for regulatory clarity which we haven't seen yet."""

1,up,37,2021-11-30, India misinterpreted private crypto ban says crypto bill creator ,The creator of India’s crypto bill former Finance Minister Subhash Garg dismissed the notion of banning “private cryptocurrencies” as a misinterpretation while highlighting the enormous potential of cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology.The Parliamentary discussions around a controversial crypto bill sparked fears around the ban on cryptocurrencies with no clear indication about the ban's scope. As Cointelegraph reported an episode of panic selling among Indian investors followed the announcement. In an interview with local news channel News 18 Garg clarified:“[The description of the crypto bill] was perhaps a mistake. It is misleading to say that private cryptocurrencies will be banned and to intimate the government about the same.”He believes that the Indian government should formulate a bill after discussing it with stakeholders and crypto investors. Furthermore the bill suggests banning private cryptocurrencies without clarifying what the word “private” stands for.As a result the crypto community in India self-interpreted two different versions of the bill’s agenda — one that considers banning all non-government issued cryptocurrencies and the other that excludes cryptocurrencies running on the public blockchains such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH).Garg also pointed out a flaw in classifying cryptocurrencies as assets after underscoring the vast ecosystem powered by disruptive technology. He also said that crypto exchanges have limited interests and do not represent the entire community:“You don’t classify the wheat that you produce you don’t classify the clothes you produce as assets. That is too much of oversimplification to treat this as an asset.”On an end note Garg added that the central bank digital currency (CBDC) initiatives especially in countries like India are complex. According to him the government first needs to address challenges including the unavailability of smartphones and digital wallet issuance.Related: Singaporean crypto exchange enters India amid regulatory uncertaintyThe Indian crypto market continues to attract international firms with the latest being Coinstore a Singaporean crypto exchange. As Cointelegraph reported Coinstore has allocated a $20-million fund to set up three new offices in the region.Speaking to Cointelegraph Coinstore spokesperson was hopeful for the development of a positive crypto regulatory framework:“Strict KYC process security requirement for exchanges as well as gradual regulation of certain cryptocurrencies naturally protects the Indian users and would clarify the legality of certain cryptocurrencies.”

However the number of users is “the key metric” he said:“If a coin has a large number of users then we will list it. That’s the overwhelming significant attribute. Consider for example meme tokens even though I personally don't get it if it's used by a large number of users we list it. We go by the community my opinion doesn’t matter.”According to Binance’s listing tips from its CEO the number of users is just one of many factors for listing a token on the crypto exchange. “If you have a large number of users your product has value. That’s the easiest to measure. Do include the user statistics in the application form. It will help significantly” the CEO’s statement on Binance listings reads.According to Sergei Khitrov founder of crypto listing-focused platform Listing.Help major crypto exchanges like Binance don’t need to list minor tokens as they earn mainly from trading volumes rather than listings.“This is one of the main problems that many projects do not understand. They should start with building a community. And that means no 500 or 10000 people in a Telegram channel but a much larger audience” Khitrov told Cointelegraph. He added that token creators are recommended to start from smaller exchanges.At the time of writing Binance exchange supports a total of 346 cryptocurrencies including major cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH) as well as popular meme tokens like Dogecoin (DOGE) and Shiba Inu (SHIB) according to data from CoinGecko. Binance’s daily trading volume is estimated at $28 billion.In comparison OKEx the second-largest crypto exchange by trading volumes has listed 312 coins and has a trading volume of roughly $7 billion. The United States-based crypto exchange Coinbase supports just 123 tokens with a daily trading volume of about $6 billion.Some major centralized exchanges (CEX) have more tokens listed than Binance does with Bittrex listing over 450 cryptocurrencies at the time of writing.Related: Kraken exchange defies competitors’ regulatory concerns with SHIB listingAs opposed to a CEX decentralized exchanges (DEX) are the world’s biggest platforms in terms of the number of listed cryptocurrencies as DEXes like PancakeSwap do not require contacting an exchange or asking permission. As such PancakeSwap a DEX running on the Binance Smart Chain has over 3200 listed tokens while Uniswap lists over 1800 cryptocurrencies.Last month PancakeSwap listed the Squid Game (SQUID) token a cryptocurrency scam inspired by the eponymous Netflix show which posted over 45000% growth in a few days after launch. The token is listed on Binance-owned crypto website CoinMarketCap while competitors like CoinGecko retracted from listing SQUID due to being “most likely a scam.”
